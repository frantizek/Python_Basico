# Kaprekar constant

Ah, the Kaprekar constant! It’s a number that’s quite fascinating in the realm of mathematics, specifically number theory. For a four-digit number, Kaprekar's constant is 6174. Here’s the intriguing part: Take any four-digit number, where the digits are not all the same, and follow these steps:

Arrange the digits in descending and then in ascending order to get two four-digit numbers, adding leading zeros if necessary.

Subtract the smaller number from the bigger number.

Repeat the process with the resulting number.

No matter what four-digit number you start with, you'll always reach the number 6174 in at most 7 iterations. This is known as Kaprekar’s routine, and 6174 is the Kaprekar constant.

For example, if you start with the number 3524:

Step 1: Arrange in descending order: 5432, and in ascending order: 2345.

Step 2: Subtract: 5432 - 2345 = 3087.

Step 3: Repeat with 3087: 8730 - 0378 = 8352.

Continue this until you reach 6174.

Isn't it amazing how mathematics can have such fascinating patterns?
